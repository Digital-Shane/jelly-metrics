# Jelly Metrics

This is a Jellyfin Metric exporter that provides the following metrics with minimal cardinality.

* Media count by type.
* Connected clients by username.
* Actively playing streams by username.

I use this is my [Ultimate Jellyfin on macOS guide](https://github.com/Digital-Shane/jellyfin-on-macos?tab=readme-ov-file#monitoring). An grafana dashboard using these metrics and others by the Jellyfin metrics endpoint is available in that repo.
